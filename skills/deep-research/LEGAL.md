- [ ] Flag areas of unsettled law
- [ ] Note any pending legislation that could change analysis
- [ ] Check for superseding regulations

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Citing dicta as holding**: Distinguish what court decided vs said
2. **Ignoring subsequent history**: Cases get reversed, overruled
3. **Wrong jurisdiction**: State law varies significantly
4. **Missing circuit splits**: Federal law may differ by circuit
5. **Outdated statutes**: Check for amendments
6. **Overreliance on secondary sources**: Always verify against primary
7. **Confusing proposed with final rules**: Check Federal Register status
